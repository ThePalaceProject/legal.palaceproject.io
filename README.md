# Github Pages Site

This repo is a simple github pages site that contains the legal documents used for the Palace Project.

## Original Files

The original word files from our lawyer are stored in the [word](/word) folder and markdown versions are stored
in the [docs](/docs) folder and published to https://legal.palaceproject.io with github pages.

## Conversion

The word documents were converted to github markdown using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) with the `gfm` output type.
